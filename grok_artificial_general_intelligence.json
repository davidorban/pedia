  "summary": "AGI is a hypothetical type of artificial intelligence capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge to accomplish any intellectual task that a human being can perform. As of October 2025, no system has achieved AGI, with current AI models demonstrating impressive but limited capabilities. AGI would possess the ability to generalize across diverse domains, adapt to novel tasks, and demonstrate reasoning and problem-solving capabilities across different contexts. The concept originated in mid-20th century AI research, experienced multiple 'AI winters' of reduced funding and progress, but has seen recent resurgence through large language models and scaling techniques. Potential benefits include economic productivity enhancement, scientific and medical research acceleration, individual cognitive augmentation, and improved security systems. However, significant risks exist including alignment challenges, economic disruption, potential existential risks, and ethical uncertainties about machine intelligence.",
