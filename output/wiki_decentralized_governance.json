  "title": "Decentralization",
  "summary": "Decentralization is 'the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those related to planning and decision-making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group and given to smaller factions within it.' The concept has been applied across multiple domains including group dynamics, management science, political science, law, public administration, technology, economics, and money. The word 'centralisation' came into use in France in 1794 during the post-Revolution French Directory leadership. Decentralization can be initiated through 'top-down' (from centers of authority) or 'bottom-up' (from individuals/localities) processes. It is often seen as a response to the problems of centralized systems and promises to enhance efficiency through both inter-governmental competitions with market features and fiscal discipline.",
