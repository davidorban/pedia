  "summary": "A 'digital asset' is defined as 'anything that exists only in digital form and comes with a distinct usage right or distinct permission for use.' These assets include digital documents, audio content, motion pictures, and data stored on various digital devices. Digital assets include software, photography, logos, illustrations, and animations. Metadata helps make digital assets more accessible, easier to manage, and more complex. There is limited existing governmental control and regulation surrounding digital assets globally. Digital assets are increasingly complex due to rising number of devices that leverage these assets. The legal landscape around digital assets is uncertain, with control issues relating to access and transferability maintained by individual companies. Note: Wikipedia does not have a dedicated article on UAE digital asset regulation specifically. This information is from the general Digital Asset article, and no UAE-specific regulatory information was found in Wikipedia sources.",
