5. **Blockchain** - 142 references, technical depth
6. **Entrepreneurship** - Academic rigor with empirical evidence
7. **Elon Musk** - Balanced multi-venture coverage

## Alignment with David Orban's Expertise

| Topic | David's Expertise Level | Grokipedia Quality | Comparison Value |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Bitcoin | Deep (since 2010) | 35/35 | Exceptional |
| Cryptocurrency | Deep (15+ years) | 35/35 | Exceptional |
| SpaceX | Strong (Mars infrastructure plans) | 34/35 | High |
| Robotics | Strong (AI integration focus) | 34/35 | High |
| Blockchain | Deep (Ethereum 2014, DAOs) | 33/35 | High |
| Entrepreneurship | Deep (founder, investor, advisor) | 33/35 | High |
| Elon Musk | Informed (parallel interests) | 33/35 | Medium-High |

## Comparison Dimensions (Quality-Focused)

For each topic, evaluate:

1. **Accuracy** - Factual correctness, up-to-date information
2. **Depth** - Technical detail, nuance, comprehensiveness
3. **Timeliness** - Currency of data (2024-2025 vs older)
4. **Epistemic Framing** - How knowledge is presented, uncertainty handling
5. **Citations** - Quality and breadth of references
6. **Readability** - Organization, clarity, accessibility
7. **Balanced Perspective** - Multiple viewpoints, controversy handling

## Expected Insights

This selection allows us to:
- Compare platforms where BOTH have strong coverage
- Evaluate quality differences when coverage exists
- Assess how AI-generated (Grokipedia) vs community-edited (Wikipedia) affect quality
- Identify strengths/weaknesses in content presentation approaches
- Determine if Grokipedia's depth claims (25K words vs Wikipedia's 5K) translate to better quality

## Next Steps

1. Retrieve full content from both platforms for all 7 topics
2. Conduct dimension-wise quality evaluation
3. Generate comparative analysis focused on content excellence
4. Synthesize findings about quality trade-offs between platforms
