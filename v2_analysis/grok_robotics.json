  "title": "Robotics",
  "summary": "Robotics is a branch of engineering and computer science involving the design, construction, operation, and application of robots—machines programmed to execute complex tasks automatically, often substituting for human effort in repetitive, dangerous, or precision-demanding activities. The field's modern origins trace to the mid-20th century, with the Unimate, the first industrially deployed robot arm, installed at a General Motors plant in 1961 to handle die-casting tasks, marking the start of automated manufacturing on a large scale.",
