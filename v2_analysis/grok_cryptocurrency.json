  "summary": "Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed for peer-to-peer electronic transactions, utilizing cryptographic methods to secure transfers and regulate issuance without centralized intermediaries. Bitcoin, created in 2008 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, pioneered this approach by solving the double-spending problem through distributed consensus. The technology enables borderless, censorship-resistant value transfer, challenging traditional financial systems.",
