  "title": "Blockchain",
  "summary": "A blockchain is a 'distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.' Each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a hash of the previous block, creating a chain resistant to alteration. Blockchains are typically managed by peer-to-peer networks using consensus algorithms, and were first created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 for Bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions.",
