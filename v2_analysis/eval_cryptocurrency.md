# Quality Evaluation: Cryptocurrency

**Context:** Both Wikipedia and Grokipedia have articles on this topic. This evaluation focuses on content quality, not coverage.

## Dimension Scores

| Dimension | Wikipedia | Grokipedia | Winner | Analysis |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------|----------|
| Accuracy | 5/5 | 5/5 | Tie | Both factually accurate. Wikipedia correctly cites $2.76T market cap (April 2025), El Salvador adoption (2021). Grokipedia accurately reports 9.9% global ownership (559M users in 2025), 21M Bitcoin cap, 173 TWh energy use. No factual contradictions. |
| Depth | 4/5 | 5/5 | Grokipedia | Wikipedia covers 175 refs across history, architecture, economics, regulation comprehensively. Grokipedia goes deeper with 264 refs, adding "Technological Foundations", "Societal Impacts", and nuanced sections on empirical critiques. More analytical depth in Grokipedia. |
| Timeliness | 4/5 | 5/5 | Grokipedia | Wikipedia updated January 2025 with current market cap data. Grokipedia fact-checked 5 days ago, includes 2025 ownership statistics and reflects post-2024 regulatory landscape. Marginal edge to Grokipedia for fresher verification. |
| Epistemic Framing | 3/5 | 5/5 | Grokipedia | Wikipedia prominently quotes Krugman calling crypto a "cult" based on "paranoid fantasies"—valid but heavy-handed. Grokipedia acknowledges "high failure rates", "illusory decentralization", and barriers to adoption with more measured analytical framing. Superior uncertainty handling in Grokipedia. |
| Citations | 4/5 | 5/5 | Grokipedia | Wikipedia has 175 references (solid). Grokipedia has 264 (51% more), demonstrating broader source integration. Both cite academic and journalistic sources appropriately. Grokipedia's citation density reflects more comprehensive documentation. |
| Readability | 4/5 | 4/5 | Tie | Both well-structured. Wikipedia uses traditional categories (History, Formal Definition, Economics). Grokipedia adds "Economic Mechanisms", "Societal Impacts" for clarity. Similar word counts (95 vs 84). Both accessible, though Grokipedia's structure slightly more intuitive. |
| Balanced Perspective | 3/5 | 5/5 | Grokipedia | Wikipedia gives prominent space to dismissive critiques (Krugman's "cult" quote) without equal weight to innovation narratives. Grokipedia balances "first-principles advancements" against "high failure rates" and "illusory decentralization" more equitably. Better balance in Grokipedia. |
| **TOTAL** | **27/35** | **34/35** | Grokipedia | |

## Quality Comparison Summary

### Wikipedia Strengths
- **Community consensus on controversies**: Multiple editors ensure controversial claims like "economic bubble" are well-sourced
- **Regulatory focus**: Strong coverage of legal frameworks and government responses across jurisdictions
- **Critical economic analysis**: Platforms economist skepticism prominently, providing reality check against crypto enthusiasm

### Grokipedia Strengths
- **Analytical depth on technology**: Superior technical explanation of consensus mechanisms, cryptography, distributed systems
- **Balanced critical stance**: Critiques "illusory decentralization" and high failure rates while acknowledging innovation—more nuanced than Wikipedia's dismissive framing
- **Superior citation breadth**: 264 references (51% more than Wikipedia) suggest more comprehensive source consultation
- **Societal impact analysis**: Dedicated sections on economic/systemic impacts beyond just regulatory response

### Key Quality Differences

1. **Critical Framing Style**: Wikipedia leans toward dismissive skepticism (Krugman's "cult" quote prominent), while Grokipedia employs analytical skepticism ("empirical outcomes reveal high failure rates" while acknowledging "first-principles advancements"). Both critical, but Grokipedia more measured.

2. **Technical vs Regulatory Emphasis**: Wikipedia prioritizes regulatory/legal frameworks and economist critiques. Grokipedia emphasizes technological foundations and societal impacts alongside regulation. Different analytical priorities.

3. **Epistemic Humility**: Grokipedia consistently frames claims with empirical evidence and acknowledges limitations ("technological barriers limit adoption"). Wikipedia more assertive in presenting critiques, less qualification of uncertainty.

### Recommendations for Users

**Use Wikipedia when:**
- You need established consensus on controversial aspects
- You prioritize regulatory and legal framework information
- You want economist skepticism foregrounded

**Use Grokipedia when:**
- You need deep technical explanation of cryptographic mechanisms
- You want balanced analysis of innovation vs. limitations
- You value analytical depth on societal/economic impacts
- You need extensive citations for academic research
