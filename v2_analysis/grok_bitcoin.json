  "summary": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency enabling direct online payments without intermediaries, operating on a blockchain network. Introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, it uses proof-of-work to secure transactions and validate blocks. The protocol has a hard cap of 21 million coins, creating predictable scarcity. Bitcoin challenges centralized financial systems by offering a transparent, pseudonymous payment network with no single controlling entity.",
