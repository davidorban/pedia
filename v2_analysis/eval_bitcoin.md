# Quality Evaluation: Bitcoin

**Context:** Both Wikipedia and Grokipedia have articles on this topic. This evaluation focuses on content quality, not coverage.

## Dimension Scores

| Dimension | Wikipedia | Grokipedia | Winner | Analysis |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------|----------|
| Accuracy | 5/5 | 5/5 | Tie | Both maintain factual rigor. Wikipedia cites 81.7M users (June 2023), Grokipedia cites 559-590M global crypto users (2025). Both accurately describe technical fundamentals (21M cap, proof-of-work, blockchain). No factual errors detected in either. |
| Depth | 4/5 | 4/5 | Tie | Wikipedia covers history, design, economics deeply with 166 references. Grokipedia provides similar depth with 266 references, adding foundational principles section. Both explain technical mechanisms comprehensively, though structure differs. |
| Timeliness | 3/5 | 5/5 | Grokipedia | Wikipedia references 2025 events but feels less current. Grokipedia explicitly fact-checked 5 days ago, includes 2025 global ownership data, and reflects more recent market dynamics. Currency of information noticeably fresher in Grokipedia. |
| Epistemic Framing | 4/5 | 4/5 | Tie | Wikipedia presents economists' "economic bubble" concerns with proper attribution (Refs 150-154). Grokipedia frames Bitcoin as challenging centralized systems while acknowledging controversies. Both handle uncertainty responsibly, though tonal differences exist. |
| Citations | 4/5 | 5/5 | Grokipedia | Wikipedia has 166 references (solid). Grokipedia has 266 references (60% more), demonstrating broader source consultation. Both cite authoritative sources appropriately. Grokipedia's reference density suggests more thorough documentation. |
| Readability | 4/5 | 4/5 | Tie | Both well-organized. Wikipedia uses traditional structure (History, Design, Economics). Grokipedia adds "Foundational Principles" upfront, which aids comprehension. Word counts similar (85 vs 84). Both accessible to general audiences. |
| Balanced Perspective | 3/5 | 4/5 | Grokipedia | Wikipedia emphasizes criminal use, regulatory bans, bubble concerns prominently in summary. Grokipedia presents "challenges to centralized systems" more neutrally while including dedicated "Controversies and Criticisms" section. Both cover criticisms, but Grokipedia balances innovation narrative better. |
| **TOTAL** | **27/35** | **31/35** | Grokipedia | |

## Quality Comparison Summary

### Wikipedia Strengths
- **Established factual authority**: Mature article with extensive edit history ensures accuracy through community review
- **Skeptical balance**: Prominently features economist critiques and regulatory concerns, providing counterweight to hype
- **Neutral tone on controversial topics**: Presents criminal use and bubble concerns without advocacy

### Grokipedia Strengths
- **Superior timeliness**: Fact-checked 5 days ago with 2025 data versus Wikipedia's older references
- **More comprehensive citations**: 266 references vs 166 (60% more), suggesting deeper source consultation
- **Innovation-focused framing**: Emphasizes technological merit and decentralization benefits while maintaining critical sections
- **Clearer structure**: "Foundational Principles" section aids reader comprehension before historical deep-dive

### Key Quality Differences

1. **Temporal Currency vs Editorial Maturity**: Grokipedia's AI-generated content reflects 2025 context more accurately, while Wikipedia's community-edited approach provides tested stability but lags on timeliness.

2. **Tonal Framing**: Wikipedia leads with skepticism ("economic bubble", "criminal use"), while Grokipedia leads with technological innovation ("challenges centralized systems") then addresses controversies. Both factually accurate but frame differently.

3. **Reference Density**: Grokipedia's 60% higher reference count suggests more aggressive citation practices, though this doesn't necessarily equal superior quality—could reflect AI generation patterns versus human editorial curation.

### Recommendations for Users

**Use Wikipedia when:**
- You want community-vetted content with established consensus
- You prefer skeptical framing that foregrounds risks
- You're researching historical context (pre-2024)

**Use Grokipedia when:**
- You need the most current 2025 data and market conditions
- You want technical innovation context alongside criticisms
- You value extensive citation breadth for further research
