  "summary": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology maintaining a continuously growing list of cryptographically secured records called blocks. Originating from Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 Bitcoin whitepaper, it enables secure transactions without trusted third parties by using consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work. Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain supports applications in supply chain, health records, and smart contracts, offering transparency, immutability, and decentralization.",
